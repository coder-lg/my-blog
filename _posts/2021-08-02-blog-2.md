Oh hey. Long time no blog.
<!--more-->

I have been busy.

Very busy.

I recently signed up for `coding.blog`, a VERY GOOD platform for blogging. They basically sanction a domain which needs an open source blog repository with their own CODEDOC. And, it has been useful. Now, I have a blog where I teach things on coding. I added this blog and the tech blog's RSS there. Will add redirects. As a final conclusion, the new blogs I got are:

- From `coding.blog`, and the domain is [***`https://coderlg.coding.blog`***](https://coderlg.coding.blog)

- From nowhere, obviously Jekyll, and the domain is [***`https://coder-lg.github.io/tech`***](https://coder-lg.github.io/tech)

And, at last,
- From GitHub, my public notes domain is [***`https://notes-of-coder-lg.vercel.app`***](https://notes-of-coder-lg.vercel.app)

See ya!
