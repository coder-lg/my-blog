Hello.

It's been a YEAR since my last blog, so let's start it with a big BANG!

![lets start with da big BANG](https://c.tenor.com/F-wcAOFZpCEAAAAC/big-bang-stars.gif)

Now, apologies for the lack of a proper introduction.

I have been gone, due to school "torture". But it's a bit fun now, especially in math, and even the Tesla Coil. See, I am a coder, and I love coding. But at the same time, I am a tech enthusiast, and I love technology. A tech aficionado, you can say.

> Between you and me, some buttheads call me "nerd" just 'cause I am not like them.
Stereotypical.

But still, that got me thinking about wireless charging. And the Tesla Coil. Somehow, my brain drew a line(a lot) between the two. And then, I kinda got an idea - what if, the Tesla Coil was the base of wireless charging tech _and_ NFC(**N**ear **F**ield **C**ommunications)?

I promise, I will make it into my school science expo if my speculations are right. For now, let it be just my hypothesis.

So, let's start, shall we?

Now, where shall we start?

## The Tesla Coil

I believe this is a good place to start.

> Full history of the Tesla coil, and details at Wikipedia.

Quoting Wikipedia here!

> A Tesla coil is an electrical resonant transformer circuit designed by inventor Nikola Tesla in 1891. It is used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity. Tesla experimented with a number of different configurations consisting of two, or sometimes three, coupled resonant electric circuits.
Tesla used these circuits to conduct innovative experiments in electrical lighting, phosphorescence, X-ray generation, high frequency alternating current phenomena, electrotherapy, and the transmission of electrical energy without wires. Tesla coil circuits were used commercially in sparkgap radio transmitters for wireless telegraphy until the 1920s,[1][3] and in medical equipment such as electrotherapy and violet ray devices. Today, their main usage is for entertainment and educational displays, although small coils are still used as leak detectors for high vacuum systems.[4][5]
Originally, Tesla coils used fixed spark gaps or rotary spark gaps to provide intermittent excitation of the resonant circuit; more recently electronic devices are used to provide the switching action required.

So, that is huge.

I think I heard people say that we could wirelessly charge things around a Tesla Coil. Sorry for the less info here :/

## Wireless Charging

So, all this starts at 1831.

> a lot of details [here](https://www.moshi.com/en/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-wireless-charging/#:~:text=When%20wireless%20charging%20first%20hit,you%20walked%20by%E2%80%94like%20magic.)

Micheal Faraday proved that wireless charging is possible, and Nikola Tesla made a smack-dab 200-foot radio energy transmitter. Thing is, I believe that the Tesla Coil is the base of wireless charging. But anyway, back on track.

The way wireless charging works is, your new iPhone 13, or perhaps a better phone to use here, the Nothing phone(1) has coils around the back of it. There are another set of coils on the wireless charging pad of yours. Now (let me tell as a note: MagSafe is just Qi Wireless Charging with magnets, so it's similar, but not the same. Sorry Apple for roasting you, I hate to do that.) is, when they are in _close_ contact, the coils kinda sense it. They start transmitting energy through those coils and get your phone juiced up. Same with reverse wireless charging. Let me tell you, it would seem obvious, but the way with wireless charging is that, your phone is not hooked up to wires. It would be like, stop(near your wireless charging coil), drop(your phone there) and go. Purely cleaner than a MESS of wires. It _is_ slow, but it gives juice to go. Most flagships have it with NFC, which is a tech that uses wireless charging to send a coded message through the coils, and transmits to the other device. A simple way to explain this is with a Nothing phone(1) and a Yubikey 5 NFC(security key). If I have them, I just have to tap the Yubikey on the phone's abck and the phone will recognize it as a security key. That way, it works on my laptop + phone, if I ever had one with NFC (lol).

## My relating lines:

Wireless charging works via coils. Tesla's RET(radio energy transmitter) also should use coils, IDK, but the Tesla coild did, and it transmits energy, and possibly lighted and balsted bulbs(attack time on foolhardy people).

Wireless charging with NFC: tap the back of a phone, share your contact info or login via a security key, and cheerio.

So... I bet you a free Zorin tutorial on, "THIS IS TRUE". If I am wrong, force me to add a Zorin tutorial, hand-typed.

Oh, I type _with_ hands.
