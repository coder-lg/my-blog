Good upgrade, bad mistake

Good news + bad news
<!--more-->

Bad news: my official github blog, the one I had with 200 commits and more, is gone :sad: :angry:

I wish, if GitHub reads this, they will send me an email that my official blog can be reclaimed. I would be happy to get that.

Good news?

I started a tech blog.

Not so bad. Because, tech is one big part of our life.

So, if you wanna read the first post, click the button [`here`](https://coder-lg.github.io/tech) and head over to the first post and if and only IF you want, sub the RSS. See ya!
